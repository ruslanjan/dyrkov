I recommend setting the following GAME PC settings:

1. Disable System Page File in Windows (required) -- This will prevent game memory from being paged to disk which may cause undefined behavior.

2. Enable 'Automatic RAM Cleaner' In-Game (recommended) -- This will help prevent running out of memory, which is vital especially when disabling the system page file.

3. Enable 'MIP Streaming' In-Game (recommended) -- same as above.
