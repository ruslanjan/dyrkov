A really fun way to play dyrkov :) EFT

Not being updated anymore since they changed their major unity version but if you update the address pointers and some structures then most of it should still work. 
Happy reverse engineering :)

I recommend setting the following GAME PC settings:

1. Disable System Page File in Windows (required) -- This will prevent game memory from being paged to disk which may cause undefined behavior.

2. Enable 'Automatic RAM Cleaner' In-Game (recommended) -- This will help prevent running out of memory, which is vital especially when disabling the system page file.

3. Enable 'MIP Streaming' In-Game (recommended) -- same as above.
